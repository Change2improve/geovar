# GEOVAR: Geometric Variation

Automatic generation of **all possible** _geometric variations_ from a _constrained part_.
> _**constrained object(s)** refers to any part designed, generated, and/or rendered around a set of variables (e.g. width, length, thickness, etc.)_

> _**geometric variations**, variants, or derivatives refers to any part created from altering, modifying, or changing the value of a single or multiple variables that define an original, constrained object_

> _**all possible** refers to the number of permutations dependent on the original object's number of constraints (Nvars) and the range of possible values for ech constraint (Nvals)_
